\end{center}
There are many ready-made implementations in the world to simplify people's lives in different spheres. For example, there are many automated services in our city to simplify various life processes. If you want a quick snack, use Wolt, Glovo. Need a taxi, delivery? Install Yandex Taxi, Didi. But what if the human soul wants to do good and do charity? In practice, the fact was noticed that it was quite difficult to find points where it would be possible to donate unused things, share food and be aware of the charity actions of activists. One application could become a single center for all charitable activities. you can join various events or, conversely, announce an event. It would be possible to be aware of donations for food and clothing, or perhaps even find out which orphanages/nursing homes can be visited and helped.
