## Project
Name: Charity Hub
Main goal: An application for various types of charitable activities.
Desсription: There are a lot of automated services in our city to simplify various life processes. If you want to have a quick meal, use Wolt, Glovo. Need a taxi, delivery? Install Yandex Taxi, Didi. But what if my soul wants to do good and do charity. In personal practice, the fact was noticed that it was rather difficult to find points where one could donate unused things, share food, and keep abreast of charity events of activists. This application could become a single point of all charitable activities. You can join different events or, on the contrary, announce an event. Be aware of food and clothing donations or maybe even find out which orphanages/nursing homes you can visit and help.

## Alternatives / Market research
Research alternatives
1. **Share The Meal** - This is a charity application from the World Food Program that allows you to feed children in need with a single touch of the screen. As the world faces a record number of emergencies, hunger levels are rising.
2. **Подари жизнь** - The official application of the Gift of Life Foundation. It tells about the work of the foundation and projects. You can choose what kind of help you want to provide: subscribe to monthly donations, become a donor or volunteer. For the convenience of users, Google Play and Apple Pay are implemented in the application. Not so long ago, the mobile application of the Gift of Life Foundation took second place in the nomination "State and Society" of the Runet Rating award.
3. **Помощь** - This is the world's first mobile application of targeted and transparent assistance. The project is like an assembly point of a new time, uniting generations. The first target group for targeted assistance is the elderly.
4. **Food Drive** - to provide targeted assistance with products. In the application, you can get acquainted with the database of promotions, addresses of participating stores and choose any location, ward, date and type of assistance you like. You can make both a one-time purchase of products and regular donations. Usually these are food packages at a price from 150 rubles to 2 thousand rubles. Through Food Drive, you can also feed stray cats and dogs - it's enough to buy food.
